Captain
=======
Handling GitHub web hooks, so you don't have to.

Captain is a lightweight PHP script that runs commands server-side when it recieves a payload containing commit data. It can act as an endpoint for multiple repositories and branches, which is handy for keeping the testing branch up-to-date in another location than the master branch.

Installation
------------

* Upload
* Edit index.php (it's okay to rename it)
* Set up your GitHub repository to use the script as a web hook
* Commit away!
